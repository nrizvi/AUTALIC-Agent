Is it People with Autism,0,0,0
While I understand the rest of the criticisms of the organization I just dont see whats bad about wanting to cure autism,1,1,1
The crux of what I wanted to convey with this post is that despite Autism Awareness Month being about autistic people compared to bigname orgs and parents autistic peoples perspectives are rarely centered or listened to outside very specific spaces and some ways to help change that,0,0,0
Maybe by being autistic it also subverts the gender norms for autistic women too but because I am a man I did not want to assume that,0,0,0
Suck it up and admit that youre not neurotypical and stop making it harder for the real NTs out there,0,1,0

The issue Im facing is that no matter what type of disability Im trying to incorporate to the images ends up being ignored,-1,0,0
Aspergers is in my mind a subcategorization of autism,-1,1,1
So I 29M suffer from some type of highfunctioning autism I was diagnosed late at 21 and at first I felt positive about it but the more I realized how it was responsible for different problems in my life like severe romantic anxiety inability to hold all but a couple of very niche jobs and feeling disregulated by things as simple as changes in weather the more I grew to hate it to the point where I was su1c1dal in my early to mid 20s until I got TMS therapy for the depressive aspect of it,1,0,1
Stupidly got into twitter spat with this person after I made the mistake of disagreeing with her she claimed in her profile to be anti feminist and pro real equal rights,0,0,0
He swears hed qualify for disability and will apply to help with bills but only doctor hes seen is his pcp,0,0,0
I was pretty sure Im neurodivergent to some degree and while ASD seemed most plausible I did consider ADHD and ADD as other possibilities,0,0,0

In August of 2018 it was discovered that one of the animators that worked on your show was a pedophile That and I forced myself to see the show in its entirety and its at least 70 less cringeworthy and insufferable than I thought it was There seems to be multiple points throughout the show where it seems like the crew members are enablingencouraging the sexually divergent aberrant behavior of bronies like that rear shot of Sweetie Belle in the Season 3 episode Babs Seed the presence of daikamuras in that one episode from a later season alluding to the virginistic waifuism of this overrated POSs fans That and the Brony mass shooter from April of last year you people arent innocent you have blood on your hands 

Lets make this clear you people exist and still exist sadly to my chagrin entirely because of the actions of Christian Christine Weston Chandler and his her exgirlfriend Megan Schroeder in 2007ish It goes like this

Chris creates a bunch of Sonichu recolors whose personalties suspiciouslly resemble that of the six main characters of your show   Megan gets Chris into MLP 2007  Lauren Faust reads the Sonichu comic and is inspired by those recolors in the creation of the Main 6  MLPFIM premieres in 2010 to little fanfare but quickly blows up like an ICBM on the internet thanks to some autistic anons on 4chans co board who more likely than not were inspired by Chris himself this isnt transphobeek because Chris was still a male at the time and there you fucking have it
